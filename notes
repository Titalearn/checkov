Certainly! **Checkov** is a powerful tool for scanning and analyzing **Terraform** infrastructure as code (IaC) files. It helps identify security and compliance issues, misconfigurations, and best practices violations in your Terraform code. Here are some key points about Checkov:

1. **Installation**:
   - You can install Checkov using **pip** from PyPI: `pip install checkov`.

2. **Basic Usage**:
   - To scan your Terraform files, navigate to the folder containing your Terraform plan files and run the following command:
     ```
     checkov -d /path/to/your/terraform/files
     ```
   - This will analyze your Terraform code and provide insights into potential issues.

3. **Scanning Third-Party Terraform Modules**:
   - Third-party Terraform modules often simplify complex deployments. However, they can sometimes abstract the configuration away from a regular Checkov scan.
   - To ensure coverage of objects within these modules, you can instruct Checkov to download external modules referenced in your Terraform configuration files:
     ```
     checkov -d . --download-external-modules true
     ```
   - This command will download external modules into a folder named `.external_modules`.

4. **Experimental Feature**:
   - If you've already downloaded external modules using Terraform (stored in the `.terraform` folder), you can use the following environment variable to leverage those modules:
     ```
     CHECKOV_EXPERIMENTAL_TERRAFORM_MANAGED_MODULES=True checkov -d .
     ```
   - This works for scans of the root folder where `terraform init` was executed.

5. **Scanning Private Terraform Modules**:
   - If you have private modules stored in a repository or a private Terraform registry, you can grant Checkov access by providing access tokens as environment variables.
   - Variables include `GITHUB_PAT`, `BITBUCKET_TOKEN`, `TF_HOST_NAME`, `TFC_TOKEN`, `TF_REGISTRY_TOKEN`, `BITBUCKET_USERNAME`, and `BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD`.

6. **Example**:
   - To scan a private module in the Terraform Cloud registry:
     ```
     export TF_REGISTRY_TOKEN=xxxxxx
     checkov -d . --download-external-modules true
     ```
